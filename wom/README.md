# ppc ./ppc
Modification of PPC to support the WOM and sanity checks

This repository contains both the simulation files to create the necessary PPC input files (./wom_setup) as well as a modified ppc version (./ppc) and sanity checks (./checks).

# wom setup ./wom_setup
Contains four folders with simulations for the effective area, angular sensitivity, PMT selection and time delay.

# checks ./checks
Contains four folders (ang_sens, eff_area, pmt_selection, time_delay) with PPC simulation script and analysis scripts intended to cross check the implementation in ./ppc
